# 426-Final-Project
Final project using a Flights api to create a web application

travel planning?
    * pick a place to eat based on where you are going/number of people in party/using yelp
    * if someone wants a flight that doesn't exist we would make a new flight (saved to use for future searches)
    * create a new seat for this person (max number of seats on the plane/if plane is full make a new plane with the next day flight)
    * live interactive feature (search updates in real time)
    * have three random airlines that we choose to assign to the plane/flights
